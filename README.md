# Project Luigi

This is a minimal Electron scaffold for **Project Luigi**, a cross-platform budgeting app themed after Luigi from the Mario series.

## Running the App

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Install dependencies (requires internet access):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Electron application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The current build shows a simple "Year at a Glance" table with Luigi-themed colors. Further development is required to implement full budgeting features, automation, and secure data storage.
